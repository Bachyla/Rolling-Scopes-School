## Description
```
For the first time in Belarus. Starting at Imaguru on August 30th, continuing on a train in Riga,
finishing after our arrival in Riga and ending at ///.
The now legendary Hackatrain attracts developers, designers and entrepreneurs from all over the world,
all hoping to strike it big, hackathon-style.

This isnâ€™t your typical hackathon. Say goodbye to boring venues and hello to travelling around with
more than 50 fellow hackers competing across mobility challenges.
Are you ready for Hackathon on Train Minsk-Riga?
